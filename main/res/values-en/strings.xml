    <string name="instruction_content">Welcome to the minesweeper.\n\n        In this game you have to reveal every empty cell without ever revealing a hidden bomb.\n\n        Touch a cell to try revealing it.\n\n        You can also press the flag button, then a cell, in order to mark it, if you think there is\n        a bomb there.\n\n        To help you, the revealed cells indicate how many bombs there are in the 8 adjacent\n        cells.\n\n        Good Luck!</string>
